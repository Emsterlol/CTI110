  <p>My experience at Wake Tech with learning HTML has made me realize the important foundation for building websites and web applications for what we use every day. We all use our web browsers for something, whether it be to look something up on Google or watch a video on YouTube. With HTML, I can develop my creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills to use on my own websites for this semester or to do my own projects for fun. In today's digital age, coding has become an essential skill that can provide students with numerous opportunities to pursue their passions and careers and I feel that I have grown a lot in my first semester at Wake Tech. By teaching HTML in school, you provide students with the necessary knowledge to pursue various careers in web development, graphic design, and digital marketing. I feel I have been given a competitive edge in today's digital landscape that will help me in my future career wherever I decide to go. My final thoughts are that HTML is a valuable skill that I cant wait to learn more about and I enjoyed all my teachers, lessons, and classmates this semester.</p>
